            <h2>Anxiety Disorders :</h2>
            <p>Anxiety Disorders are a cluster of mental disorders characterized by significant and uncontrollable
                feelings of anxiety and fear. Social anxiety disorder is a fairly common psychological disorder that

            <h2> Bipolar Disorder :</h2>
            <p>People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms.
                During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a
                loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day. Manic symptoms may
                include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased
                talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and
                impulsive reckless behavior. People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide.

        <div class="elements" id="depression">
            <h2>Depression :</h2>
            <p>Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in
                everyday life. During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad,
                irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every
                day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor
                concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts
                about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or
                low in energy.</p>

        <div class="elements" id="addiction">
            <h2>Addiction :</h2>
            <p>Mental disorders are associated with drug use including: cannabis, alcohol and caffeine, use of which
                appears to promote anxiety. For psychosis and schizophrenia, usage of a number of drugs has been
                associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and AMPHETAMINES.There has
                been debate regarding the relationship between usage of cannabis and bipolar disorder. Cannabis has also
                been associated with depression. Adolescents are at increased risk for tobacco, alcohol and drug use;
                Peer pressure is the main reason why adolescents start using substances. At this age, the use of
                substances could be detrimental to the development of the brain and place them at higher risk of
                developing a mental disorder. </p>
